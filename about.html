<p><b>The Gospel of Net Zero</b> <sup style=font-size:10px>GONZ</sup> is a majestic vision that symbolizes the global commitment to addressing climate change and achieving a state of "<b>Net Zero</b>". It is essentially a call to action rooted in the recognition that the urgent need to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions to a level where they are balanced by efforts to remove or offset an equivalence and balanced amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere of the Earth and beyond.

This corporate gibberish is mostly the product of ChatGpt3.
<br>
It should form no part of the surprise, that a <b>Great</b> (Technocratic)<b> narrative</b> would be devoid of any spirit and 100% focused on the physical self. I mean.. "Ja The Wearables, NEIN!" I don't know what I expected? Anyway also, also, Jump Down, Turn Around Pick a Bale Of Cotton. I've edited it as best as I can and continue to play with it. That's what she said! Shama Lama Ding Dong Moan! 
<br>
It is singularly incapable of spitting out anything remotely funny, ironic or pithy and it certainly won't put out anything remotely angry or beautiful. It is unlikely to do so either given that all the language surrounding the subject is dry, boring, unfunny, sole less, technocratic -et al. It also appears to be limited in it's vocabulary; the subject itself being more a collection of catch phrases and techno-jargon than anything usable in any context other than propaganda. I live in hop that one day ChatGpt3 will produce something at least a little bit good that could remain sans edit, though I'm not holding my breath.
<blockquote>
	<b>ME</b>: "Write the third verse for the "Gospel of Net Zero" whilst praising our lord and saviour Greta Thunberg. The text should have NO POETIC or RHYTHMIC structure and be in the style of the KJV."
<br><br>
<b>CHATGPT</b>: Now in these times, Greta emerges as a guiding light, A fervent advocate, steadfast in her fight. With unwavering dedication, she champions the Earth's plea, A resolute follower of the Gospel, inspiring you and me.
</blockquote>
It's like working with an overly tired child. And that's just me.
