<sup>About The Gospel Of Net Zero</sup>
<!-- <h2 id="About"></h2> -->
<p><b>Here is a quote from WWF's website:
	</b></p>
<blockquote>"The Amazon rainforest plays a critical role in our fight against climate change."</blockquote>
<p><b>This is what the President of The United States had to say about the climate terror</b>:
</p>
<blockquote>"The climate is really hot people. Trust the science.. My wife Kamala * crispy forearm!" Joe Biden <sup>TBC</sup></blockquote> 
<p><b>The Gospel of Net Zero</b><sup>GONZ</sup> is a Wholistic vision that symbolizes the global commitment to addressing climate change and achieving a state of "<b>Net Zero</b>". It is essentially <b>a call to action</b> rooted in the recognition that the urgent need to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions to a level where they are balanced by efforts to remove or offset an equivalence and balanced amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere of the Earth and beyond.
<br>
This <b>Gospel Of Net Zero</b><sup>GONZ</sup> emphasizes the collective responsibility of individuals, communities, businesses, and nations to transition to <b>sustainable practices</b>, such as renewable energy, conservation, and carbon capture, to secure a more environmentally balanced and sustainable future for our planet moving forward.</p>
